# flutter_automaton

A SOLID Clean Architecture foundation for learning to craft scalable  Flutter apps.

## Why?

I've found it increasingly frustrating to find a clean architecture sample app that is up to date 
with the latest Flutter best practices.  Further, the quality of Flutter documentation is fantastic,
but posts on StackOverflow and Medium are often out of date, don't provide a complete picture, or 
are simply bad coding practice.

This sample app is intended to be a tool for developers who want to learn how to craft
scalable Flutter apps using SOLID clean architecture principles **the right way**. ;-)  

Of course, 
many developers will have differing opinions on what the "right way" is.  So more specifically, this
sample app is my attempt to collect everything I've personally learned, read, tried, refactored, and implemented
in Flutter in the same place.  Then, I'll filter that through 15 years of software development 
experience and distill it into an opinionated sample app that will:

1. Demonstrate actual general software best practices
2. Provide an example of a directory structure to organize a complex Flutter app
3. Provide an example of state management using the BLoC pattern in Flutter
4. Adhere to Clean Architecture principles
5. Serve as a Bootstrap for new Flutter apps
6. Integrate many common Flutter packages
   1. BLoC
   2. Flutter Serializeable
   3. Equatable
   4. Copy With
   5. go_router
   6. GetIt
   7. firebase_auth
   8. firebase_core
   9. firebase_firestore
   10. 

## Feedback Welcome!

If you come across something I can improve or want to suggest a cleaner approach, or maybe something
you'd like to see added in the future, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
